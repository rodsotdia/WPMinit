# WPMinit
A personal blank minimal theme for WordPress, to start any project from scratch.

Includes:
* Useful general functions, filters, actions and shortcodes, related to WordPress.
* Some functions, filters and actions, related to plugins, such as [ACF Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/), [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) and [Lazy Load](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rocket-lazy-load/).
* [Tailwindcss] for utility classes(https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) + some modifications.
* [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) to generate styles.
* [PostCSS] to generate the final css assets using mainly `autoprefixer` and `cssnano`.
* MailChimp API connection. Uses this [API Wrapper](https://github.com/drewm/mailchimp-api).
* [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) to build js assets.
* Some scripts and JavaScript libraries that I've regularly used, such as [Swup](https://github.com/swup/swup), [Swiper](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper), [Bowser](https://github.com/lancedikson/bowser/), [JavaScript Cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie) and [GSAP](https://github.com/greensock/GSAP).

*This is a work in progress*
