# WPMinit
A personal blank minimal theme for WordPress, to start any project from scratch.

Includes:
* Useful general functions, filters, actions and shortcodes, related to WordPress.
* Some functions, filters and actions, related to plugins, such as [ACF Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/), [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) and [Lazy Load](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rocket-lazy-load/).
* A bunch of utility styles.
* MailChimp API connection. Uses this [API Wrapper](https://github.com/drewm/mailchimp-api).
* Some scripts and JavaScript libraries that I've regularly used, such as [Swup](https://github.com/swup/swup), [Bowser](https://github.com/lancedikson/bowser/), [JavaScript Cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie), [GSAP](https://github.com/greensock/GSAP), [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic), [SmoothScroll](https://github.com/gblazex/smoothscroll-for-websites), [Infinite Scroll](https://github.com/metafizzy/infinite-scroll), [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), [Slick](https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/), and [fancyBox](https://github.com/fancyapps/fancybox).

This is a work in progress.
